# Tittle: Effects of Divalent Cations on Structure and Dynamics of Water Confined Between Lipid Bilayers

## Abstract
Membrane-water interfaces host various chemical reactions that are vital for cellular functions. Among these, ion binding at the membrane-water interface plays a crucial role in modulating the structural properties of interfacial waters, such as their hydrogen-bond network and dipole alignment [1,2], which are critical for cellular processes. However, the influence of ion binding on dynamics of interfacial water molecules remains poorly understood [3]. Here, we employ molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to systematically investigate how varying concentrations of biologically relevant divalent cation salts [4] affect the transport dynamics of water molecules confined between lipid bilayers composed of 14:0 PC (DMPC). We find that the presence of divalent cation salts causes the displacement distribution of confined water molecules to deviate from Gaussian significantly. Using recently proposed theory of transport dynamics of complex fluids [5], we extract the magnitude and relaxation dynamics of the diffusion coefficient fluctuation from the non-Gaussian displacement distribution. While the relaxation time increases with the cation concentration regardless of cation species, the mean and variance of the lateral diffusion coefficient exhibit qualitatively different dependencies on cation concentration depending on the cation species.
